# Robot Simon Says

A webiste meant for teaching kids the basic of programming control flow. The webiste will take in a JSON file describing a list of robots as well as some code to control a robot, and then the robot tab will run that code on each robot described in the JSON.
You can look into the `robot_samples` folder for an example JSON file to provide to the page for learning how it works.
